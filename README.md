## Running Locally
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/crash1604/SpotifyLookalike.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd SpotifyLookalike`
3. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
4. Activate the virtual environment:
    - On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
    - On macOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`
5. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Apply migrations: `python manage.py migrate`
7. Run the development server: `python manage.py runserver`

## Manual Testing with Pre-Written API Test Calls

To facilitate manual testing of SpotifyLookalike, you can use the following pre-written API test calls. These calls are formatted in a `.rest` file, and you can use tools like [REST Client for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) to execute them.

### Prerequisites
- Ensure that the project is running locally. If not, follow the "Running Locally" instructions mentioned in the README.

### API_TEST.REST File
- Locate the file name `API_TEST.rest` for a comprehensive testing cases
- Works well with REST client for Visual Studio code

Feel free to customize the test calls based on your specific scenarios and data. Execute these calls using your favorite REST client, and enjoy testing your SpotifyLookalike application! ðŸš€

Feel free to explore and enhance the functionality according to your needs! Enjoy your SpotifyLookalike experience! ðŸŽ¶
